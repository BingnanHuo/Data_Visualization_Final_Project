## Generative Art

The pictures below are artworks generated using the `aRtsy` [package](https://github.com/koenderks/aRtsy), which uses some algorithms with certain parameter and randomization settings to generate beautiful pieces autonomously.

#### 95% Confidence Interval of 100 Experiments

Here is a plot showing the effects of the confidence level on the proportion of intervals that would successfully capture the true mean and the width of confidence intervals. We have randomly generated 100 samples with normal distribution, mean=0, SD=1, and sample size=50. Since our sample are randomly generated, we know what the true "population" mean is -- here being 0 since all the samples were generated under $\mathcal{N}(0,1)$. In these 100 samples, all but 5 of them successful captured the true mean. In the interactive version of this plot, you could adjust the confidence level and notice that the intervals would become wider as confidence level increases, and vice versa. For a 95% confidence interval, we would expect only 95% samples, in repeated sampling, to be able to produce intervals that captures the true mean. And this is exactly what we are see here with our generated "samples" and intervals.

### ggplot extensions -- ggside

#### Poor Sleep Quality vs Stress Score and Alcohol Use - Density & Box

This is a plot Gabby, Grace, and I created for our ggplot extensions project. Our package was `ggside` , which allows us to see information (for example, the distribution) regarding a single axis in a bivariate plot like this scatter plot shown above. We used the `Lock5Data` datasets package and the `SleepStudy` dataset in it. This dataset contains observations about the sleep patterns of college students with a sample size of 253. In this plot, we used *PoorSleepQuality* and *StressScore* variables and scattered them, while also using *AlcoholUse* to group the observations. The top side is showing a boxplot of *PoorSleepQuality* in each *AlcoholUse* level; the right side is showing the density curves of *StressScore* grouped by *AlcoholUse* level. We are trying to see if stress scores might be correlated with poor sleep quality -- so the more stressed a person is, the worse their sleep quality is; or the worse they sleep, the more stressed they are. We also also interesting to see if alcohol use was a factor in here, since we hypothesized that more alcohol use would lead to both higher stress score and worse sleep quality (meaning a higher "poor sleep quality"). The results, however, are not indicating a correlation between *PoorSleepQuality* vs *StressScore* for students in every alcohol consumption level. But, we still found something interesting thanks to the ggside extension. The boxplot on *PoorSleepQuality* indicates that students who don't drink any alcohol (Abstain) has the lowest median *PoorSleepQuality*, while those who drink heavily has the highest median *PoorSleepQuality*. This means that those who don't drink at all has the better sleep quality and drinking even "lightly" would result in worse sleep quality, while drinking heavily would really hurt their sleep quality.

#### Leading Causes of Death in U.S. by Year

This is a plot I recreated during Exam 2 using provided dataset on US cause of deaths. The variables involved are the time (year) and the number of death in that year, grouped by causes of deaths. We are noticing that total number of death in the US had a jump from 2019 to 2020 -- the increase is roughly 300,000 death and almost all of that can be attributed to COVID-19. We are also noticing that there are gradual but slight increases in total number of deaths for all causes in general over the years 2015 to 2019 (before COVID started). I think it might be because of the population growth the US had experiences decades ago. So it is natural to see more deaths; it doesn't mean people are getting less and less healthy.

#### Completion Rate vs. First-Gen (By Black Undergrads Proportion)

I made this plot in Exam 1. The dataset that is used is the **CollegeScores** dataset in the `Lock5Data` package, on the details about "all US post-secondary schools collected by the Department of Education for the College Scorecard." The variables I used for this plot is the proportion of first-gen college student and the completion rate (within 150% of normal time) for each college. The observations are also grouped by the percentage of black Undergrads at that college. This variable is a categorical was created previously by slicing the quantitative variable on the proportion of black undergrads at a college.

We are noticing several things in this scatter plot. Firstly, if we ignore the groupings and the colors for a moment, we see that just the dots alone are showing a moderately strong, linear, and negative correlation between the variables. The higher first-gen proportions are, the lower the completion rates. However, we will notice another thing if we now also take into account of the groups. The regression line for high proportion black undergrads universities is lower than the other two lines, meaning that even if at the same level of first-gen rates, universities with more black undergrads would tend to have lower completion rates.

Besides, we are seeing most of the universities with high proportion of black undergrads located toward the lower right part of the graph. This represents that most universities with high proportion of black undergrads also tend to have higher first-gen rates and lower completion rates.
